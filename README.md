# TenableOne_For_Splunk_App

# Tenable Vulnerability Management (TVM)


Capabilities:
	•	Asset discovery (active scanning)
	•	Vulnerability detection (plugins, CVEs)
	•	Severity & CVSS
	•	Patchability / solution guidance
	•	Scan configuration & execution
	•	Credentialed vs non-credentialed coverage
	•	Scan recency & freshness

⸻

# Tenable Web Application Scanning (WAS)

Application-layer exposure

Capabilities:
	•	Web application inventory
	•	Dynamic web scanning
	•	Authenticated web scanning
	•	API scanning
	•	Findings & severity
	•	Scan execution state

Distinct from VM — different engine, different asset type.

⸻

# Tenable Attack Surface Management (ASM)

External exposure discovery

Capabilities:
	•	Internet-facing asset discovery
	•	Domains, IPs, cloud resources
	•	Continuous change detection
	•	Net-new / removed assets
	•	Attribution & ownership inference

This is outside-in visibility, not scanning.

⸻
# Tenable OT Security

Operational Technology / IoT

Capabilities:
	•	Passive OT asset discovery
	•	Protocol inspection
	•	Asset classification
	•	Purdue model context
	•	Sensor-based visibility
	•	Sensor health & performance

No active scanning by default — fundamentally different data source.

⸻
# Tenable Identity Exposure

Identity-centric risk

Capabilities:
	•	Identity discovery
	•	Privileged accounts
	•	Exposure paths
	•	Misconfigurations
	•	Identity attack paths

This is identity graph + exposure, not vulnerability scanning.

⸻
# Tenable Cloud Security

Cloud-native exposure

Capabilities:
	•	Cloud asset inventory
	•	Misconfigurations (CSPM)
	•	IAM risk
	•	Workload exposure
	•	Cloud attack paths

Cloud control plane + workload posture.

⸻

# Exposure Scoring & Analytics (Lumin / Exposure View)

Cross-domain analytics layer

Capabilities:
	•	Unified exposure score
	•	Risk trends over time
	•	Prioritization across surfaces
	•	Correlation across VM, WAS, ASM, OT, Identity, Cloud



⸻

# Assets (Unified Asset Inventory)

Cross-cutting object

Capabilities:
	•	Asset normalization
	•	Asset correlation across sources
	•	Context enrichment
	•	Ownership and criticality



⸻

# Findings / Exposures (Unified Findings Model)

Cross-cutting object

Capabilities:
	•	Vulnerabilities
	•	Misconfigurations
	•	Exposures
	•	Identity risks
	•	Web findings



⸻

#  Sensors, Scanners, and Collectors

Data acquisition layer

Includes:
	•	Nessus scanners
	•	WAS engines
	•	ASM collectors
	•	OT sensors
	•	Cloud connectors

Health, capacity, and coverage matter here.

⸻

#  Users, Roles, and Access Control

Platform governance

Capabilities:
	•	Users
	•	Roles
	•	Permissions
	•	API access

⸻

#  Platform Telemetry & Health

Operational integrity

Capabilities:
	•	Scan success/failure
	•	Partial scans
	•	API usage & limits
	•	Data freshness
	•	Ingestion health

# Attack Path Analysis

	•	Correlates vulnerabilities, identities, misconfigurations, and exposure
	•	Models attacker movement
	•	Identifies choke points and high-impact paths
	•	Prioritizes remediation based on exploitability + reachability, not severity alone
